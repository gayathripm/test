StatusNet 1.0.0beta3
27 August 2011

This is the README file for StatusNet, the Open Source social
networking platform. It includes installation instructions,
descriptions of options you can set, warnings, tips, and general info
for administrators. Information on using StatusNet can be found in the
"doc" subdirectory or in the "help" section on-line.

About
=====

StatusNet is a Free and Open Source social networking platform. It helps
people in a community, company or group to exchange short (140
characters, by default) messages over the Web. Users can choose which
people to "follow" and receive only their friends' or colleagues'
status messages. It provides a similar service to sites like Twitter,
Google Buzz, or Yammer.

With a little work, status messages can be sent to mobile phones,
instant messenger programs (GTalk/Jabber), and specially-designed
desktop clients that support the Twitter API.

StatusNet supports an open standard called OStatus
<http://ostatus.org/> that lets users in different networks follow
each other. It enables a distributed social network spread all across
the Web.

StatusNet was originally developed for the Open Software Service,
Identi.ca <http://identi.ca/>. It is shared with you in hope that you
too make an Open Software Service available to your users. To learn
more, please see the Open Software Service Definition 1.1:

    http://www.opendefinition.org/ossd

StatusNet, Inc. <http://status.net/> also offers this software as a
Web service, requiring no installation on your part. See
<http://status.net/signup> for details. The software run
on status.net is identical to the software available for download, so
you can move back and forth between a hosted version or a version
installed on your own servers.

A commercial software subscription is available from StatusNet Inc. It
includes 24-hour technical support and developer support. More
information at http://status.net/contact or email sales@status.net.

New this version
================

This is a security release since version 0.9.7 released on 11 March
2011. It fixes security bug #3260. All sites running version 0.9.7 or
below are recommended to upgrade to 0.9.9 immediately.

Notable changes this version:

- Fix bug #3260, a cross-site scripting (XSS) bug that allows an
  attacker to inject JavaScript into a page with a carefully structured URL.
- Updated code for Google Analytics to reflect new API.
- Various fixes for Bookmark plugin.
- Updates to reCAPTCHA plugin based on changes to API.
- New plugin to move the site notice to the sidebar.
- Add rss.me to notice source list.
- Updates to data backup/restore.
- Correct use of "likes" in Facebook plugin.
- Ignore failures in Twitter plugin.

A full changelog is available at http://status.net/wiki/StatusNet_0.9.9.

NOTE: The short-lived StatusNet 0.9.8 ("Letter Never Sent") did not
adequately fix bug #3260 as originally thought; thus this new release.

Troubleshooting
===============

The primary output for StatusNet is syslog, unless you configured a
separate logfile. This is probably the first place to look if you're
getting weird behaviour from StatusNet.

If you're tracking the unstable version of StatusNet in the git
repository (see below), and you get a compilation error ("unexpected
T_STRING") in the browser, check to see that you don't have any
conflicts in your code.

If you upgraded to StatusNet 0.9.x without reading the "Notice
inboxes" section above, and all your users' 'Personal' tabs are empty,
read the "Notice inboxes" section above.

Myths
=====

These are some myths you may see on the Web about StatusNet.
Documentation from the core team about StatusNet has been pretty
sparse, so some backtracking and guesswork resulted in some incorrect
assumptions.

- "Set $config['db']['debug'] = 5 to debug the database." This is an
  extremely bad idea. It's a tool built into DB_DataObject that will
  emit oodles of print lines directly to the browser of your users.
  Among these lines will be your database username and password. Do
  not enable this option on a production Web site for any reason.

- "Edit dataobject.ini with the following settings..." dataobject.ini
  is a development file for the DB_DataObject framework and is not
  used by the running software. It was removed from the StatusNet
  distribution because its presence was confusing. Do not bother
  configuring dataobject.ini, and do not put your database username
  and password into the file on a production Web server; unscrupulous
  persons may try to read it to get your passwords.

Unstable version
================

If you're adventurous or impatient, you may want to install the
development version of StatusNet. To get it, use the git version
control tool <http://git-scm.com/> like so:

    git clone git@gitorious.org:statusnet/mainline.git

This is the version of the software that runs on Identi.ca and the
status.net hosted service. Using it is a mixed bag. On the positive
side, it usually includes the latest security and bug fix patches. On
the downside, it may also include changes that require admin
intervention (like running a script or even raw SQL!) that may not be
documented yet. It may be a good idea to test this version before
installing it on your production machines.

To keep it up-to-date, use 'git pull'. Watch for conflicts!
